# Numerical-Errors
The purpose is to study the behaviour of the error function with respect to order of the approximation. Because of systems' memory, speed, and incapacity to complete an infinite number of operations in a finite amount of time, those approximations can be be estimated using python.

Results
As it can be seen, the graph of the error between approximation and the actual value of eâˆ’0.3 is more sharp and the error decreases faster, comparing to the other graphs. Moreover, it can be noticed that as the values of x increases, the order required to reduce error also increses. That is, for x=0.3, the order is 11, for x=1, the order is 16, and for x=2, the order is 22. However, it is supprising to observe that at some point the error start to steadly increase. Which means that there is a specific point at which it is possible to achieve the minimum possible error.

Conclusion
In this assignment the main goal was to observe the behaviour of the error function as the x and order of approximation increases. As it was found both the order and values of x play a significant role in the behaviour of the error function.
